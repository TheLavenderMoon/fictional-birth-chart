# fictional-birth-chart
This is a simple program for overzealous astrology fans who also like fictional characters (authors, webcomic fans , ... ). Since many fictional characters don't have an actual birth time and/or place you can figure them out yourself and insert them into this program by hand and it will give you natal aspects, synastry aspects, composite aspects, composite to natal aspects, house placements, ...

GUI hasn't been written yet.
